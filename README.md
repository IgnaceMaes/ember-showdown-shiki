# ember-showdown-shikiji

ember-showdown-shikiji is a drop-in addon that automatically adds [Shikiji](https://shikiji.netlify.app/) syntax highlighting to code blocks if you are using [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to render your Markdown.

This addon also provides filename wrappers to the code block if a code block is marked with a `data-filename` attribute:

```markdown
````gjs {data-filename=app/templates/blog-post.gjs}
<template>
  <h1>{{@model.title}}</h1>
  <h2>by {{@model.author}}</h2>

  <div class="intro">
    {{@model.intro}}
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="body">
    {{@model.body}}
  </div>
</template>
```Â 
```

You will also notice that the code sample has line numbers, this is built-in behaviour and they will be added to all code blocks.

This is also specifically designed to work in Node environments so that it can run effectively in Fastboot and prember ðŸŽ‰ and as it is a drop-in addon it will automatically start working if added to any Empress projects, so it can be used to add syntax highlighting to your empress-blog if your template doesn't already provide syntax highlighting.

This addon is inspired by the great work of [ember-showdown-prism](https://github.com/empress/ember-showdown-prism).
